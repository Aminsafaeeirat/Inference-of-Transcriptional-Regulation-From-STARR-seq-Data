# Inference-of-Transcriptional-Regulation-From-STARR-seq-Data

This repository contains code to guide you in fitting models to mPRA experimental data, such as STARR-seq. The main file, main.ipynb, works in conjunction with a data file (e.g., your_data_file.csv).

# Workflow
The code is organized into three main sections:
1-Loading the Data
2-Running the Monte Carlo Code
3-Plotting the Results

# Usage Instructions
Place your experimental data in a file named your_data_file.csv in the asked format.
Run the Jupyter notebook main.ipynb step by step to perform the analysis.
Additional instructions and explanations are provided in the code comments.
